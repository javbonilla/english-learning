The **present perfect** is formed from the **present tense of the verb *have*** and the **past participle** of a verb.

| Forma | Sujeto | present tense of the verb **have** | past participle |

| You have walked | You haven't walked | Have you walked? |
| He, she, it has walked | He, she, hasn't walked | Has he, she walked? |
| We have walked | We haven't walked | Have we walked? |
| You have walked | You haven't walked | Have you walked? |
| They have walked | They haven't walked | Have they walked? |

We use the present perfect:

- For something that **started in the past** and **continues in the present**:

> *They'**ve been married** for nearly fifty years.*
>
> *She **has lived** in Liverpool all her life.*

- When we are talking about our **experience up to the present**:

> I'**ve seen** that film before.
>
> I'**ve played** the guitar ever since I was a teenager.
>
>He **has written** three books and he is working on another one.

- We often use the adverb ever to talk about experience up to the present:

> My last birthday was the worst day I **have ever had.**

- And we use *'never'* for the negative form:

> Have you ever met George?
>
> Yes, but I'**ve never met** his wife.

- For something that happened in the past but is important in the present:

> Estela **has slept** much better tonight.
>
> I can't get in the house. I'**ve lost** my keys.

## Vocabulary

### Question tags

[Amigos ingleses: aprende a usar los question tags](https://www.amigosingleses.com/2018/02/22/aprende-usar-las-question-tags-en-ingles/)

O preguntas coletillas, son esas preguntas cortitas que se añaden al final de la frase porque no se está seguro de cierta información, o preguntas retóricas.

> Hablas italiano, verdad? / *You speak italian, **don't you***?

La estructura de la frase siempre será: **VERBO AUXILIAR + PRONOMBRE PERSONAL**

Además, si la frase es positiva, la *tag question* es negativa. Y al revés: si la frase es negativa, la *tag question* será positiva.
